# Engeto Academy: Selections Scraper

This is the final project within Engeto Academy.

## Project Description
This project can be used to extract the results of the parliamnetary elections in 2017.

### Libraries installations
The libraries used in this project are saved in the file `requirements.txt`. For installation, I recommend using a new virtual environment and installed manager(pip):

```
$ pip3 --version
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Project Launch
All necessary information is displayed after running the file `elections_scraper.py`
The program will ask you to insert a link to the relevant territorial unit. Then you will have to type the name of the new csv. file where the result will be saved.
